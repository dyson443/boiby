    <h2>iMac</h2>
    <h3>Plastic Intel iMac Models (2006) </h3>
    <p>The Early 2006 models of this iMac design have 2 SO-DIMM slots that are easily accessible via the bottom cover, supporting a total of 2 GB of DDR2-667 RAM.</p>
    <p>The Late 2006 models (so all 24-inch models of this design) of this iMac also have 2 SO-DIMM slots that are easily accessible from the bottom, however these support 4 GB of DDR2-667 RAM.</p>
    <h3>Early Flat Aluminium iMac Models 2007 - Mid 2009)</h3>
    <p>Original Mid-2007 model Aluminium iMacs, like the older plastic models, also have 2 SO-DIMM slots that are easily accessible via the bottom cover, now supporting 6 GB of DDR2-667 RAM.</p>
    <p>Early-2008 model Aluminium iMacs also have 2 SO-DIMM slots that are easily accessible via the bottom cover, but support 6 GB of slightly higher-speed DDR2-800 RAM.</p>
    <p>Early-2009 models of this design are still the same, except support 8 GB of DDR2-800 instead of 6.</p>
    <p>Mid-2009 models are identical, except use DDR3-1066 instead of DDR2-800, still supporting the same 8 GB maximum</p>
    <h3>Later Flat Aluminium iMac Models (Late 2009 - 2011)</h3>
    <p>The original Late-2009 models of this era have 4 SO-DIMM slots, easily accessible via the bottom cover. Dual-core processor models support 16 GB of DDR3-1066 RAM, and 27-inch quad-core models support 32 GB.</p>
    <p>Mid-2010 models use faster DDR3-1333 instead of DDR3-1066, but are otherwise identical for RAM upgrades.</p>
    <p>All Mid-2011 models support 32 GB of DDR3-1333 RAM, still having 4 SO-DIMM slots easily accessible from the bottom cover.</p>
    <p>The Late-2011 cut-down education model supports 16 GB of DDR3-1333 RAM, but is otherwise identical for RAM upgrades.</p>
